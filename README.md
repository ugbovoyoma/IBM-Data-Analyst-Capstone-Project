# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project

Hey there! I’m so glad to have you here. This is a very important project to me because it is my first after completing every necessary course to become a data analyst. This project would showcase every skill I have learnt within the last few months.

On this project, I took on a role as a newly hired Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for their expertise in IT solutions and their team of highly experienced IT consultants. 

In order to keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, my organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. 

As a Data Analyst, i will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. 

My first task is to collect the top programming skills that are most in demand from various sources including:

•	Job postings

•	Training portals

•	Surveys

Once i have collected enough data, i will begin analyzing the data and identify insights and trends that may include the following:

•	What are the top programming languages in demand?

•	What are the top database skills in demand?

•	What are the popular IDEs?

I will begin by scraping internet web sites and accessing APIs to collect data in various formats like .csv files, excel sheets, and databases. 

Once this is completed, i will make that data ready for analysis using data wrangling techniques. When the data is ready i will then want to apply statistical techniques to analyze the data. Then bring all of my information together by using Google Looker Studio to create my dashboard. And finally, show off my storytelling skills by sharing my findings in a presentation.

An interesting journey is ahead, walk with me.
